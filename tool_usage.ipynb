      "- In some cases, Python 3.11 can be up to 60-64% faster than 3.10\n",

      "\n",
      "2. New features:\n",
      "- Python 3.11 introduces some new syntax and features like improved error locations in tracebacks, exception groups to handle multiple errors, and task/exception groups in asyncio.\n",
      "- 3.11 also has enhanced typing features like variadic generics and support for self type\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Compatibility:\n",

      "In summary, the main benefit of upgrading from Python 3.10 to 3.11 is a substantial speed boost, with the average program running 1.25x faster and some seeing speedups of 50%+. 3.11 also brings a number of new language and standard library features, while maintaining high backwards compatibility with 3.10 code.\n"
